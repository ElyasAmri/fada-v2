## Lessons Learned

### 1. Model Size ≠ Performance
- Larger models did not outperform BLIP-2
- IDEFICS2-8B (4.34B) scored 37.5% vs BLIP-2 (2.7B) at 55%
- SmolVLM-500M outperformed some larger models

### 2. Medical Pretraining ≠ Medical Universality
- CheXagent trained on chest X-rays failed completely on ultrasound
- Domain specificity matters more than medical domain in general

### 3. Architecture Compatibility is Critical
- 44% of tested models (12/27) failed due to compatibility
- Custom architectures rarely work with standard pipelines
- Windows compatibility issues (triton, etc.)

### 4. Quantization Trade-offs
- 4-bit quantization enables testing large models
- Performance degradation varies by model
- Memory savings: ~75% (32GB→8GB for 8B models)

### 5. Latest ≠ Best
- 2024-2025 models (Qwen2.5, mPLUG-Owl2) failed
- Older, stable models (BLIP-2 from 2023) performed best
- Maturity and standardization matter

**Key Insights**:
- Latest 2024-2025 models (MiniCPM, Qwen2-VL, InternVL2) significantly outperform 2023 models
- 4-bit quantization enables testing 7-8B models on 8GB VRAM without major accuracy loss
