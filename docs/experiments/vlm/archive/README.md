# Archived VLM Documentation

**Archive Date**: October 3, 2025
**Reason**: Outdated information - BLIP-2 no longer best model

---

## ⚠️ Warning: Outdated Documentation

These documents contain **outdated recommendations and results** from early testing phases (October 1-2, 2025). They reference BLIP-2 as the best model, which has been superseded by MiniCPM-V-2.6 (88.9% vs 55%).

**Do not use these documents for current project decisions.**

For current, accurate information, see:
- `../complete_vlm_testing_results.md` (Main reference)
- `../all_models_tested.md` (Master list)
- `../vlm_testing_complete.md` (Summary)

## Historical Context

These documents represent the evolution of VLM testing:

1. **October 1-2**: Initial quick tests identified BLIP-2 as baseline (~55%)
2. **October 2**: Legacy tests of older models, quantization experiments
3. **October 3**: Comprehensive tests of latest 2024-2025 models
4. **Result**: MiniCPM-V-2.6 emerged as champion (88.9%)

The testing methodology evolved from rapid screening to comprehensive evaluation, ultimately testing 50+ models and achieving 61% improvement over initial baseline.

## Why Archived?

1. **Outdated Recommendations**: Documents recommend BLIP-2, which is now obsolete
2. **Incomplete Data**: Only show early phase results (14 models vs 50+ tested)
3. **Superseded Findings**: Main documentation provides complete, accurate results
4. **Historical Value Only**: Kept for reference, not for project decisions
