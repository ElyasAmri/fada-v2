**Target**: Research publication on VLM evaluation for fetal ultrasound

## Working Title
"Comparative Evaluation of Vision-Language Models for Fetal Ultrasound Visual Question Answering"

## Abstract
Comprehensive benchmarking of 50+ VLMs for fetal ultrasound VQA task. MiniCPM-V-2.6 achieves 88.9% accuracy, demonstrating viability of modern VLMs for medical imaging without specialized training.
